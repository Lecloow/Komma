# Kómma — Swift Student Challenge 2026

**Kómma** (from the Ancient Greek *κόμμα*, meaning *cesura* or *separation*) is a focus-first productivity app designed for students who want to finish meaningful work, not just plan it.

As a 17-year-old student, I struggled to stay focused while studying, often opening social media every few minutes and breaking my concentration.  
I tried to-do apps, but they felt cold and disconnected, and Pomodoro timers ignored what I was actually working on.

Kómma was created to fix this. It breaks every project into small, focused subtasks designed to be completed in under **20 minutes**, ensuring visible progress every time, no wasted effort, no unfinished sessions. Every completed task feels like a small win.  
When working feels good, consistency follows naturally.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Project-Based Organization**  
  Structure your work into clear projects and actionable subtasks.

- **Focus Sessions**  
  Time-boxed work sessions directly linked to your active task.

- **Distraction Blocking** *(in development)*  
  Screen Time API integration to block distracting apps during focus.

- **Celebration Moments**  
  Haptic feedback and confetti animations when a task is completed.

- **Live Activities** *(in development)*  
  Dynamic Island integration to keep your focus session visible at all times.

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Minimalist & Focused UI** — No visual noise
- **Native iOS Feel** — Familiar gestures and interactions
- **Micro-interactions matter** — Haptics, animations, feedback 

The design draws inspiration from Notion and Apple’s native apps, with every interaction crafted to feel natural on iOS.

## 📚 What I Learned

### Technical
- Managing complex state with **MVVM**
- Building reusable SwiftUI components

### Design
- Simplicity beats feature overload
- Small details dramatically affect user experience (Notion inspired)

### Personal
- Consistency beats motivation
- Clean code is an investment in the future
